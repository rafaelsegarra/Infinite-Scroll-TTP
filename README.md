# Tech Talent Pipeline - Challenge #2 Infinite Scroll 

Inspired by the popular site Pinterest, I created an infinite scroll application using a static dataset (JSON).  The infinite scrolling feature reuses pins from the dataset as needed. 



## Description

The project was created using React, react-hooks, react-infinite-scroller, styled-components, material-ui icons, and material-ui core.

## Getting Started

To install:

-Fork the repository

-While inside the clone, use the command "npm install" in the terminal to have all the dependencies in place

-Type "npm run start" and the program will automatically be locally hosted
